# General
- Fashion Pal is a web application that takes in an image of a user and a description of an event they'd like to attend, then recommends outfits from Amazons catalog and visualizes the user wearing those outfits at the specified event.
- The image of the user can be submitted as a file or captured using the webcam.
- The application must run on desktop and mobile phone browsers.
- The application interface should be pleasing, modern, and adapt to different screen sizes.
- DO NOT CREATE ANY TESTS / TEST FILES for the project

# Architecture
- The application would have a backend in NodeJs and a frontend in ReactJS
- We will use ReactJS to make the application responsive and avoid page reloads.
- We use Vitejs to manage dependencies and deal transpiling.

# User Flow


# UX

# AI APIs
- We will leverage [Nano Banana](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation) for image generation.
- We will leverage [Runway AI](https://docs.dev.runwayml.com/) for video generation.
- Whenever code generation help is needed, leverage @file ./Context7.mdc to verify API signatures or determine which APIs to use.
